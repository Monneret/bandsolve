\usage{
bandsolve(A, b = NULL, inplace = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{Band square matrix in rotated form. The rotated form can be obtained with the function as.rotated: it's the visual rotation by 90 degrees of the matrix, where subdiagonal are discarded.}

\item{b}{Right hand side of the linear system}

\item{inplace}{Should results overwrite pre-existing data? Default set to false.}

\item{D}{Rotated row-wised matrix.}

\item{D}{Rotated row-wised matrix.}

\item{b}{Right hand side of the linear system}

\item{b}{right hand side of the equation. Can be either a vector or a matrix. If not supplied, the function return the inverse of A.}
}
\value{
List with components with the solution of the linear system and the rotated matrixes L and U.

List with components with the solution of the linear system and the rotated matrixes L and U.

Solution of the linear problem.

\description{
Fast inplace solver for linears systems involving band matrix.

Fast inplace solver for linears systems involving band matrix.

Main function to solve efficiently and quickly a symmetric bandlinear system. Theses systems are solved much faster than standards system, dropping from complexity O(n³) to O(0.5*nk²), where k is the number of sub diagonal.
